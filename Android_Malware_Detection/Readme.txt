Business Understanding

With the popularity of Android devices, the number of applications made for the android operating system is also increasing day by day. But the biggest challenge in this scenario is to identify if an application is an authentic application or a malware. This project tries to identify an application as malware/not based on the permissions required by the application.
Ideas
We have listed out some of the ideas to solve the problem.
1.	Find the number of rows and columns in the given dataset to see what we are working with.
2.	Find the number of discrete and continuous variables in the dataset.
3.	If there are missing values in the continuous variables, check the number of missing values & try substituting them with mean, median and mode to see which performs the best.
4.	If there are missing values in the discrete variables, impute them with either mode or create a new category for missing values if they are more in number.
5.	For finding correlation between the different columns, plot them to see how the distribution looks like. Remove the columns which have high correlation.
6.	Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find the variance between the 2 components in type as well as visualise the distribution between them.
7.	Find the important features by doing univariate selection, principal component analysis or by passing them through ExtraTreesClassifier which will give you the important features by mapping each independent variable with the dependent variable.
Selected Idea
1.	When we did initial exploratory data analysis, we found that the dataset was about permissions given for a particular application. Permissions are wither given or not which means the data is only available as 0s and 1s.
2.	Hence the first step taken was to see which independent features dominated most of the malicious and benign types and plot them to see how the distribution was for the top 10 categories.
3.	Next step was to see the distribution between the 0s and 1s in the dependent feature column to see whether the dataset it balanced or imbalanced.
4.	Perform PCA to see whether the points w.r.t the dependent variable type is spread and clearly distinguishable or closely clustered.
5.	Once done, the next step is to find the correlation between the different columns and remove the highly correlated ones.
6.	Then we have implemented a couple of steps to find the most importance independent features before training the model with different algorithms.
Data Acquisition
1.	The data is given as a part of one file “Dataset.csv”.
2.	Since it is a dataset where permissions are either given or not given for certain applications, the data consists of independent columns which are mainly Nominal Binary in type.
3.	The size of the dataset is 271 KB.
4.	It consists of 398 rows and 331 columns.
5.	The dataset is balanced since the dependent variable column “type” has a perfectly equal distribution of 0s and 1s with each having 199 rows respectively.
