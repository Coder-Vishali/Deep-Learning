# Time series forecasting using RNN

# Recurrent Neural Network

## 1 Objective

The objective is to

• implement a recurrent neural network.

• train the RNN with time series dataset.

• Use RNN to forecast temperature for next day, based on the previous 7 days.

## 2 Steps to be performed

Tool Python3

Libraries required numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

Input Dataset - Daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990.

Deep Learning Model Recurrent Neural Network

Implementation 4A Simple RNN TimeSeriesPrediction.ipynb

## Steps

• Import required Python libraries.

• Load the dataset from CSV file.

• Prepare the dataset for training.

• Create the Recurrent neural network architecture.

• Configure the model for training, by using appropriate optimizers and regularizations.

• Train the model.

• Test the model using the test set.

• Report the results.
