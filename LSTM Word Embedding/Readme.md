# LSTM Word Embedding

## Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network

## 1 Objective

The objective is to

• implement a LSTM network.

• train the network with text dataset.

## 2 Steps to be performed

Tool Python3

Libraries required numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras

Input IMBD Dataset - Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). 

Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers).
