Implementation of AND gate using

Tensorflow

1 Objective
The objective is to
• implements the AND Gate using tensorflow, by specifying the hidden layers, cost function
and Gradient descent optimization.

2 Steps to be performed
• Create dataset of AND gate.
• Create placeholders for datasets.
• Create weights and biases.
• Adding hidden layers.
• Define log loss cost function.
• Train the model using Forward Propagation.

3 Expected Results
• Train the model that mimics AND Gate using tensorflow.

4 Modifications
• Implement backward propagation.
